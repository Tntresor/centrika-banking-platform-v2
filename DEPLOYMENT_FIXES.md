# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Addressed

✅ **Backend Server Configuration**
- Server already properly configured to listen on `0.0.0.0:8000` (not localhost)
- Health check endpoint `/health` is functional and returns JSON response
- Server binding verified and working correctly

✅ **Health Check Endpoint**
- Fast-responding health check at `/health` with status 200
- Returns structured JSON with timestamp, uptime, and version
- Tested and confirmed working on both localhost and 0.0.0.0

✅ **Deployment Scripts Created**
- `run.sh` - Simple deployment script for production
- `deploy.sh` - Alternative deployment approach
- `start.sh` - Production start script with environment setup
- All scripts made executable

✅ **Docker Configuration**
- `Dockerfile` created for containerized deployment
- `.dockerignore` configured to exclude unnecessary files
- Production-optimized multi-stage build process
- Health check configured in Docker

✅ **Production Configuration**
- `server/production.js` - Production entry point with error handling
- Updated `package.json` with `start:prod` script
- Environment variable support for PORT configuration
- Graceful shutdown handling implemented

## Current Status

The backend server is:
- ✅ Running on port 8000
- ✅ Listening on 0.0.0.0 (external access ready)
- ✅ Health check responding at `/health`
- ✅ Properly configured for deployment

## Deployment Commands

For Replit Deployments, use any of these approaches:

1. **Simple approach**: `cd server && npm install && node index.js`
2. **Script approach**: `./run.sh`
3. **Production approach**: `cd server && npm run start:prod`

## Port Configuration

- Backend server: Port 8000 (mapped to external port 80)
- Health check: `http://0.0.0.0:8000/health`
- All network bindings configured for external access
