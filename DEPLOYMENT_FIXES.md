# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Addressed

✅ **Backend Server Configuration**
- Server already properly configured to listen on `0.0.0.0:8000` (not localhost)
- Health check endpoint `/health` is functional and returns JSON response
- Server binding verified and working correctly

✅ **Health Check Endpoint**
- Fast-responding health check at `/health` with status 200
- Returns structured JSON with timestamp, uptime, and version
- Tested and confirmed working on both localhost and 0.0.0.0

✅ **Deployment Scripts Created**
- `run.sh` - Simple deployment script for production
- `deploy.sh` - Alternative deployment approach
- `start.sh` - Production start script with environment setup
- All scripts made executable

✅ **Docker Configuration**
- `Dockerfile` created for containerized deployment
- `.dockerignore` configured to exclude unnecessary files
- Production-optimized multi-stage build process
- Health check configured in Docker

✅ **Production Configuration**
- `server/production.js` - Production entry point with error handling
- Updated `package.json` with `start:prod` script
- Environment variable support for PORT configuration
- Graceful shutdown handling implemented

## Current Status

The backend server is:
- ✅ Running on port 8000
- ✅ Listening on 0.0.0.0 (external access ready)
- ✅ Health check responding at `/health`
- ✅ Properly configure# Deployment Configuration - Fixed

## Issues Resolved

✅ **Backend-only deployment**: Removed mobile and backoffice from deployment command
✅ **Server startup**: Added proper server startup after dependency installation  
✅ **Health check endpoint**: Added root endpoint (/) for deployment health checks
✅ **Production environment**: Added NODE_ENV=production configuration
✅ **Port configuration**: Server properly bound to 0.0.0.0:8000

## Deployment Commands (Updated)

### Recommended Deployment Command
```bash
cd server && npm ci --only=production && NODE_ENV=production node index.js
```

### Alternative Scripts
1. **Optimized script**: `./start.sh`
2. **Full deployment script**: `./deploy.sh`
3. **Production mode**: `cd server && npm run start:prod`

## Health Check Endpoints

- **Root endpoint**: `http://0.0.0.0:8000/` (for deployment health checks)
- **Detailed health**: `http://0.0.0.0:8000/health` (with system info)

## Port Configuration

- **Backend server**: Port 8000 (mapped to external port 80)
- **Network binding**: 0.0.0.0 for external access
- **Health check**: Available on both `/` and `/health` endpoints

## Production Environment Variables

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8000
```

## Deployment Process

1. Install only production dependencies (faster)
2. Set production environment variables
3. Start backend server with proper health checks
4. Server responds to deployment health checks on `/`or external access
