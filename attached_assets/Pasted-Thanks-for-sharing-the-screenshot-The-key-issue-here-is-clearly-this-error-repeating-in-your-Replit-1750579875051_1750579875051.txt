Thanks for sharing the screenshot. The key issue here is clearly this error repeating in your Replit deployment logs:

error proxying request error=dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8000: connect: connection refused

🔍 What This Error Means

Your deployment is failing because Replit expects your application to start a server on port 8000, but no process is actually listening on that port. The deployment health check fails because it tries to reach 127.0.0.1:8000 and the connection is refused.

✅ Checklist to Fix It

Here’s a targeted checklist to help you resolve the issue:

1. Your server script must start a process on port 8000

Ensure your code has something like this (for Express, for example):

app.listen(8000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 8000");
});

🔧 Check that you’re not using a different port (like 3000 or 5000) unless explicitly configured in Replit.

⸻

2. Your .replit file must run the server, not just install dependencies

Open your .replit file and verify that it looks like this:

run = "node index.js"

Replace index.js with the correct entry point (e.g. server.js, app.js, etc.)

⸻

3. Do not use npm install as your run command

This seems to be what’s happening right now. npm install installs dependencies but doesn’t start the server — so Replit sees no process on port 8000.

⸻

4. Check your package.json scripts

Ensure there’s a valid start script in package.json:

"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js"
}


⸻

5. Port hardcoding vs. environment

You can also use environment configuration to make your app more flexible:

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});


⸻

🧪 Final Test Plan

Once you’ve made the above fixes:
	1.	Double-check .replit file is executing your server script.
	2.	Confirm that port 8000 is being used and actively listened to.
	3.	Run locally in Replit shell:

node index.js

And verify that it starts correctly.

	4.	Try redeploying.

Would you like me to review your index.js, .replit, and package.json files to confirm if they’re set up correctly? Feel free to upload them.
