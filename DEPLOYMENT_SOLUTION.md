# Centrika Banking API - Deployment Solution

## Problem Addressed
**Error**: `dial tcp 127.0.0.1:8000: connect: connection refused`

This error occurs when Replit's deployment system cannot reach your application on port 8000, typically caused by:
1. Server not starting properly
2. Incorrect port binding (localhost vs 0.0.0.0)
3. Deployment command running dependencies instead of server

## Solution Implementation

### ✅ Fixed Deployment Entry Points

**Primary Entry Point**: `deploy-server.js`
- Immediate server startup on port 8000
- Binds to 0.0.0.0 (not localhost) for external access
- Background database initialization to prevent startup delays
- Essential health check endpoints

**Alternative Entry Points**:
- `index.js` - Simple deployment wrapper
- `server.js` - Full-featured production server
- `app.js` - Comprehensive banking API server

### ✅ Deployment Configuration Files

**Procfile** (for Heroku/Cloud platforms):
```
web: node deploy-server.js
```

**Root package.json** (configured for deployment):
```json
{
  "main": "deploy-server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node deploy-server.js"
  }
}
```

### ✅ Key Technical Fixes

1. **Port Binding**: Changed from `localhost` to `0.0.0.0`
2. **Immediate Startup**: Server starts before database connection
3. **Health Endpoints**: Critical `/` and `/health` routes for deployment verification
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when database unavailable
5. **Environment Variables**: Proper PORT and HOST configuration

### ✅ Deployment Commands

**For Replit Deployment**:
```bash
node deploy-server.js
```

**For Manual Testing**:
```bash
curl http://0.0.0.0:8000/health
```

## Current System Status

**Banking API Server**: ✅ Running on port 8000
- Database connectivity: Connected to Supabase
- Authentication endpoints: Functional
- User registration: Working
- Admin access: Operational

**Mobile Banking App**: ✅ Running on port 5001
- Interactive demo interface
- User registration and login
- Account management features

**Admin Dashboard**: ✅ Ready on port 3001
- Real-time banking metrics
- User management interface
- Live data integration

## Verification Steps

1. **Health Check**: `curl http://localhost:8000/`
   - Expected: JSON response with service status

2. **User Registration**: Test POST to `/api/auth/register`
   - Expected: Account creation success

3. **Database Connection**: Check logs for "Database connected"
   - Expected: Successful Supabase connection

## Production Deployment

Your Centrika Banking platform is now ready for deployment on:
- Replit (primary target)
- Heroku
- Railway
